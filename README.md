## Intructions

You should be able to run the entire notebook easily, cell by cell. You do not need to train the model on your computer, you can import the models' weights by running the corresponding cell in the notebook.

Make sure to download the models with the corresponding cell in the notebook or [through this link](https://jeanhaberer.com/cs512/project/models.zip). Unzip the file, and place it into the project folder. You can always edit the paths in the first cell of the notebook if needed.

You can find all the results at [this link](https://jeanhaberer.com/cs512/project/results.zip) or download them directly with the corresponding cell of the notebook.
