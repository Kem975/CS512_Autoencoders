# CS 512 Autoencoders
## Intructions

All the code we wrote is included in a python notebook in our personal CS512 repository. You should be able to run the entire notebook easily, cell by cell. You do not need to train the model on your computer, you can import the models' weights by running the corresponding cell in the notebook.

Make sure to [download the models through this link](https://jeanhaberer.com/cs512/project/models.zip). Unzip the file, and place it into the project folder prior to run the notebook. You can always edit the paths in the first cell of the notebook if needed.

You can find all the results at [this link](https://jeanhaberer.com/cs512/project/results.zip).
